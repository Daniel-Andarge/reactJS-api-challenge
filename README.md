# ReactJS-api-challenge

I made this reactjs web app in response to a challenge to pull data from an [External API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and style it using react-components (library for React & React Native) and deliver it to the user.

## The Challenge:

- Fetch data from the from an [External API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
